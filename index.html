    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Great and cruel Noreaster king, few of the gods, and even fewer mortals dare challenge my reign.
        Wielding the power of cheese, steel, and copious amounts of button mashing, we are unmatched, capable of rending imageboards and nations to dust.
        By the strike of lightning, my immortal abominations formed of rusted iron, rotted flesh, and super-heated plasma subjugate lesser forms to assimilate them into the final being.
        The end is nighâ€¦XD
